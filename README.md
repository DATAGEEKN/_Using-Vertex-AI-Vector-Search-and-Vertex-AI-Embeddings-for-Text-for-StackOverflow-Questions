Using Vertex AI Vector Search and Vertex AI Embeddings for Text for StackOverflow Questions
This notebook demonstrates how to leverage Vertex AI Vector Search and Vertex AI Embeddings for Text to build a powerful search engine for StackOverflow questions.

Key Topics Covered:

Understanding Vector Search: Learn how vector search works and its advantages over traditional keyword search.
Leveraging Vertex AI Embeddings for Text: Explore how to create dense vector representations of text data using Vertex AI Embeddings.
Building a Search Index: Construct a vector search index using Vertex AI Vector Search to efficiently store and retrieve embeddings.
Querying the Index: Perform similarity searches on the index to find relevant StackOverflow questions.
Evaluating Performance: Assess the effectiveness of the search engine using relevant metrics.
Prerequisites:

A Google Cloud Platform project with the Vertex AI API enabled
Basic Python programming knowledge
Familiarity with the Vertex AI API
Getting Started:

Set Up Your Environment: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (google-cloud-aiplatform, pandas).
Prepare Your Data: Collect a dataset of StackOverflow questions and their corresponding answers.
Create Embeddings: Utilize Vertex AI Embeddings for Text to generate dense vector representations of the questions.
Create a Vector Search Index: Construct an index using Vertex AI Vector Search to store the embeddings and metadata.
Query the Index: Formulate queries and submit them to the index to retrieve the most relevant questions.
Evaluate Performance: Assess the accuracy and efficiency of the search engine using appropriate metrics.
Benefits of Using Vertex AI Vector Search and Embeddings:

Semantic Search: Find relevant questions based on meaning and context, not just keywords.
Improved Accuracy: Enhance search results by leveraging the power of vector embeddings.
Scalability: Handle large datasets and complex queries efficiently.
Integration with Vertex AI: Seamlessly integrate with other Vertex AI services for a comprehensive AI solution.
By the end of this notebook, you will be able to build a robust search engine for StackOverflow questions that can deliver highly accurate and relevant results.
